Overview: The core problem addressed is the automated generation of concise summaries from lengthy texts, a process that preserves the essential information and overall meaning of the original content. This involves distilling the most important and relevant information into a shorter, coherent representation.

Steps Involved in the Project:

● Tokenizing sentences

● Creating a frequency matrix of words in each sentence

● Calculating Term Frequency (TF) and generating a matrix

● Creating a table of documents per words

● Calculating Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) and generating a matrix

● Calculating TF-IDF and generating a matrix

● Scoring the sentences

Solution Approach:
The text summarization system follows an extractive summarization approach. In extractive summarization, we select portions (sentences or paragraphs) from the original text that are most relevant and combine them into a summary. The approach can be broken down into several key
steps:
1. Text Preprocessing:
a. Tokenization: The text is split into individual sentences and words.
b. Stopword Removal: Common words that do not add significant meaning (e.g.,
“the”, “is”, “in”) are removed.
c. Stemming: Words are reduced to their root form (e.g., “running” becomes “run”).
2. Frequency Calculation:
a. A frequency table is built to count the number of times each significant word
(non-stopword) appears in the text.
3. Sentence Scoring:
a. Sentences are scored based on the frequency of words they contain. Sentences
with higher scores are considered more important.
4. Threshold Calculation:
a. The average sentence score is calculated. Sentences with scores higher than the
threshold are considered relevant for the summary.
5. Summary Generation:
a. Based on the scores, the sentences that contribute most to the overall meaning
of the text are selected and combined to form the summary
